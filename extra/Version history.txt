Ver. 1.1.4 - 3 July 2021

 *  On Legend Mode, slightly decreased the rate at which Andromeda attacks and

 *  On Legend Mode, fixed Dragon Sky's Leaf Tornado breaking through shields,

 *  Fixed a glitch in the Pegasus Magic battles on Legend Mode where each time
    he used Ice Edge, his range of movement was restricted by 1 panel.
 *  Fixed a glitch where summoned viruses would appear in the wrong position if
    a screen-dimming card was used at the exact moment the virus appears.
 *  Fixed a glitch where Green Dragon's Shield Counter invulnerability timer
    would continue to count down during screen-dimming attacks.
 *  Fixed a glitch where if you collided with an attack during Green Dragon's
    Shield Counter invulnerability while you had Counter frames active, it would
    erroneously be treated as a Counter Hit for the opponent (Enemy Counter).
 *  Fixed a glitch where, after beating Andromeda Infinity for the first time,
    using a Card Trader in that same play session would freeze the game.
 *  Fixed a glitch in the base game where if you try to summon a JunkCube in the
    middle column and the panel is occupied, it would always only try to summon
    it on the left rather than trying left and right in a random order.
 *  Adjusted the script for Kelvin's Transer so you can no longer pick it up
    multiple times when mashing the A Button.

    finish it as normal.)
 *  Fixed a glitch in the base game where you could pick up multiples of the
    snakes from Prof. Snake's Transer quest when mashing the A Button. (When you

    to switch to that page.
 *  When you delete a Study Wave in School Comps, the step counter is now

    correctly after helping a Mr. Hertz.
 *  Fixed the quest icon showing up on Teresa Tudor's Transer one chapter before

    game locks up when you try to save your clear data after the credits.

    invisibility at the start and end of every Mega Attack.
 *  Ice Pegasus Mega Man now keeps his Mega Buster charge when using Mega
    Attacks with Auto-Lock.
 *  The Data Library now shows which Battle Cards have Star Card versions, and
    tracks which ones you've collected so far. If you're upgrading from a
    previous version of MMSF DX, you can register the Star Cards in Extra
    Folders you've already obtained by switching to a different Extra Folder and
    switching back.
 *  Wave Roads now have a pulsing semi-transparency effect when seen as Geo,
    just like in MMSF2. This should make it easier to see characters and Transer
    icons which are obscured by the Wave Road.
 *  During battle, the "Battle Start" and screen-dimming card name pop-up now
    has a bounce effect, similar to MMSF2/3.
 *  During battle, when you use a screen-dimming card in single player, the card
    name pop-up is now faster.
 *  During battle, when you use a screen-dimming card, the name always appears
    at the top of screen, just like in MMSF3.

    automatically filling out the mail subject and body when you attach a
    present.
 *  Lunar Knights Brothers now have a very small chance to send their Mega
    Weapon even if they are lower than LV. 60, when they receive an item.
 *  Lunar Knights Brothers now have a small chance to send the Mega Weapon from
    a different character if you got their own Mega Weapon already.
 *  In School Comp, destroying all of the Study Waves in the area will now show
    a cutscene of the door to the next area opening automatically.

    versa, it now updates the portrait on the top screen.
 *  When you use a certain item, it now tells you your progress in a certain
    quest.
 *  When you finish all Transer quests, you will now get the e-mail from Shin
    upon the next area transition. (Previously, you only got it if you went back
    to Echo Ridge.)
 *  Andromeda on Legend Mode will now follow up gravity status with Radar
    Missile, which can be shielded, rather than an elemental meteor - similar to
    how he already did for paralysis, freeze and bubble status.
 *  Fixed Mega Man (Geo color) not having the updated hair polygon in battle.
 *  Fixed Geo (not) having his Visualizer on in some cutscenes.
 *  Fixed a glitch where hitting certain objects (e.g. RockCubes) during a

 *  Fixed a glitch in the base game where in Scrap Comp, using the Rescue Sonar
    also flashes your active Sub Card icons.
 *  Fixed a glitch where defeating an SP Boss with a certain item on would also
    count as deleting a certain other level of that boss.
 *  Fixed a glitch where if you hard reset before receiving the "DX Complete!"
    mail, one of the mails in your inbox changes into a Dummy mail. If this
    happened to you, you can fix it by sorting your mail.

    as they were supposed to when you send them rare armor items.
 *  Fixed a glitch with Lunar Knights Brothers not updating their Link Abilities
    for LV. 100 (HP+220) when they level up by receiving a rare armor item at
    LV. 95. If this happened to you, you can fix the Link Ability by deleting,
    then reforming the Brother Band.
 *  Flipped the way Cancer Bubble's claws return to his model so that on Legend
    Mode, the claw returning to his model matches the one that fired.
 *  Fixed Swill Waters not having a Transer popup during the AMAKEN blackout
    segment.
 *  Fixed a very minor sprite error on Mega Man's face picture.
 *  Fixed a rare softlock that could occur at the end of a wave in the 1000 note
    challenge.
 *  Fixed Mitch Shepar's Transer message changing for Barry Square's Transer
    quest too early.

    Navi Card needed to complete it.
 *  Fixed deleting LuPelvis in a certain boss fight on Legend Mode not counting
    towards the EM Database.
 *  Moved the Truck Navi in BIG WAVE EM-Road so he's no long covering a certain
    something when you have the Visualizer on.
 *  Fixed certain sprites on the overworld disappearing when standing in
    specific spots during some parts of the story, when there are too many
    sprites on the screen at once.
 *  Fixed a small animation glitch on Leo Kingdom's Magma Ball in Legend Mode.
 *  Fixed Old Data not being removed from your Key Items after finishing the
    associated quest. Note: it will be automatically removed if you load your
    old save file, if you already finished the quest.

    many sound effects are playing at the same time during a battle.

 *  Fixed a crash when you open a Card Trader after viewing a Lunar Knights
    Brother's message.

Ver. 1.0.5 - 31 May 2021
 *  Fixed the difficulty selection not appearing when you press NEW GAME with
    the stylus (as opposed to using the A Button or START).
 *  Fixed the display of Share Stars attack bonus on Battle Cards in the Folder
    edit screen.
 *  Share Stack attack bonus is now also shown in the Folder selection screen,
    just like in MMSF2/MMSF3.
 *  Star Cards are now treated as Standard Cards for the purposes of On Air
    Share Stars. Meaning, if you have a Star Card in your Folder and go On Air,
    it will power up the Standard Card version of that card for your Brothers.
    On the other hand, Star Cards no longer gain Share Stars.
 *  Share Stars are now disabled in Time Trials.

    many sound effects playing at once.
